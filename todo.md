# Todo

## localisation:

-   starting positions should be according to the rules, not i
-   Using circle intersections stuff, get two markers from a wall and use them to calculate the robots current position

## main

-   main loop game plan
-   CHECK TIME WAITS ARE IN SECONDS

## movement

-   Goto nearest token
-   Should tick and collect new distance data rather than expecting it to be dynamic like it currently does√ü
